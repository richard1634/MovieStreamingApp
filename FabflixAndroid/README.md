# Project 4 Android Example

This is an example Android project to demonstrate how to:

- Change between Android Activities
- Make RESTful HTTPS requests
- Maintain cookies and sessions

## Running this project

This Android app depends on [2019w-project4-login-example](https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/2019w-project4-login-example) as the backend server to work.

1. Import this project to Android Studio
2. Setup Android Emulator / real Android Device to debug (https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app)
3. Build and run this project (Make sure `project4-login-example` is up and running)

If you're running an Android Emulator in Android Studio, you can use the IP `10.0.2.2` to reference your host machine. Otherwise, if you're running this app on a real Android Device, you might need to change the urls in `RedActivity` to point to your backend server.
